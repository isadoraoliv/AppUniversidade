### App University

College work as a partial requirement for the subject of Computer Networks II.
Model of an application for the University of Ita√∫na.

In the application the student himself will assemble his school grid and then upon confirming the grid an email will be sent to
the desk to can approve the grid.
With this application we try to send those huge queues that have at the beginning of the semester, where each student has to deliver
a sheet with the grid mounted on the desk.
